## Testing Strategy
Each phase should include:
1. Unit tests for all new functionality
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. End-to-end tests for critical paths
4. Manual testing of UI/UX
5. Performance testing where applicable

## Development Guidelines
1. Create feature branches for each component
2. Write tests before implementing features
3. Document all new functionality
4. Review code before merging
5. Keep technical debt minimal

## Tools and Commands
Each phase should maintain:
1. `npm run dev` - Start development environment
2. `npm run test` - Run test suite
3. `npm run build` - Create production build
4. `npm run lint` - Check code quality
5. `npm run format` - Format code
