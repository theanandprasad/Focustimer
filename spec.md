- Schedule types:
  - Daily recurring schedules (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM every day)
  - Custom day schedules (e.g., only weekdays)
  - One-time blocks
- Visual schedule calendar
- Timezone support
- Conflict detection between schedules

### 3. Blocking Mechanism
- System-level website blocking using hosts file modification
- Browser extension integration for more robust blocking
- Support for multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Automatic bypass prevention
- Whitelist functionality for essential services

### 4. User Interface
- Clean, modern macOS-native look
- System tray/menu bar integration
- Quick enable/disable toggle
- Dark/light mode support
- Schedule overview dashboard
